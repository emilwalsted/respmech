# Changelog

All notable changes to RespMech are documented here, most recent release first.
Dates are the release (tag) date. See [Releasing](docs/RELEASING.md) for how a
release is cut, and the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/emilwalsted/respmech/releases)
for the installers themselves.

## v2.3.2 — 2026-07-24

Performance pass across the analysis pipeline and the UI, plus better progress
feedback during batch runs.

- Cached file loading and ECG removal per run instead of repeating them
- Vectorised the sliding-window RMS calculation and the sample-entropy candidate counting
- Narrowed the ECG template-fit search before evaluating candidates
- Removed an unnecessary import of the compute core just to open a window
- Preview plots now use pyqtgraph decimation and view clipping
- The Run screen shows progress during the write phase, and the overall progress bar now reaches 100%

## v2.3.1 — 2026-07-22

Fixes a packaging issue where the installed app could relaunch itself while
writing batch figures.

- Fixed the packaged app re-launching itself when writing batch figures
- Regenerated the README screenshots for the v2.3.0 UI
- More realistic sample EMG, with a recruited motor-unit interference pattern

## v2.3.0 — 2026-07-22

A UI reorganisation: a leaner Setup screen, "Advanced…" modals for less-common
settings on Preview/Mechanics/EMG, and refined plot layouts.

- Setup screen slimmed down; less-common settings moved into "Advanced…" modals on the Preview, Mechanics and EMG screens
- Channels list is now a read-only readout; the channel picker is the only place that assigns roles
- A column can now be flagged for sample entropy independently of its other role
- Cardiac-gated peak EMG exposed as an opt-in per-breath statistic, selectable from Setup
- Flow silhouette is now drawn around zero rather than around the EMG midpoint
- Diagnostic figures are now written in a separate process
- Fixed three silent-mutation bugs: an unassigned channel could silently analyse the wrong (last) column instead of raising an error, opening the channel-assignment dialog could silently drop the EMG role from analysis, and scrolling the mouse wheel over a form could silently change the setting under the cursor — including the EMG RMS window, which changes every reported EMG value. If you ran analyses on an affected build, it is worth re-checking the results
- Numerous plot-theming, spin-box and dialog fixes for Windows/macOS parity
- Releases are now published as full GitHub releases rather than pre-releases

## v2.2.2 — 2026-07-18

A packaging-only fix.

- Fixed the PyPI publish workflow to reference the publish action by tag instead of commit SHA

## v2.2.1 — 2026-07-18

First PyPI publish.

- RespMech is now published to PyPI (`pip install respmech`) via Trusted Publishing — no tokens involved
- README refreshed with new screenshots and feature graphics for the 2.2 UI, including a live before/after EMG noise-reduction example
- Sample data made more realistic: EMG bursts confined to inspiration, ECG artefact scaled to dwarf the EMG as in real recordings
- A new release now automatically notifies respmech.dk to re-publish

## v2.2.0 — 2026-07-17

A large audit pass: trust and settings hygiene, restored diagnostics, and a
full UI polish round.

- Pre-analysis resampling, previously inert, now actually runs
- Restored and upgraded the diagnostic PDF outputs
- Trend correction applied in the mechanics preview
- TOML-only settings surfaced in an Advanced panel
- XLSX output polish; removed dead entropy code
- New EMG–ECG reduction tab, with capture markers and a reactive workflow
- A discrete flow silhouette is now superimposed behind every EMG time-domain graph
- UI polish across all screens (labels, alignment, spacing, button rendering)
- The v1 monolith moved into `legacy/`, and the README rewritten for the 2.x app

## v2.1.1 — 2026-07-14

A noise-fidelity fix, plus signed installers.

- Fixed a noise-reduction precondition that previously surfaced a raw traceback instead of a clear message
- macOS installer is now notarised and signed; the Windows MSI is signed locally via Certum

## v2.1.0 — 2026-07-12

Reactive recompute redesign: the Preview screen now updates incrementally
instead of recomputing everything on every change.

- Preview recomputation is now debounced and scoped to only the parts of the pipeline a change actually affects
- Cooperative cancellation, so switching files or settings no longer waits for a stale computation to finish
- Several Windows CI timeout fixes uncovered during the redesign

## v2.0.0 — 2026-07-12

First v2 release: the PySide6 desktop app, published with installers for
Windows and macOS.

- Guided Setup → Preview & QC → Run workflow
- Windows MSI and macOS dmg installers via briefcase
- CI: Windows + macOS GUI smoke tests, Linux numerical golden tests, protecting the physiology port from v1
- Various cross-platform fixes surfaced by CI (Windows/headless failures, dark-mode rendering, checkbox visibility)
